X-Men Main Webpage Deployment Script
This repository contains a bash script to automate the deployment of the X-Men Main Webpage on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance running Apache HTTP server.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

An Amazon Linux EC2 instance with sudo privileges.
Internet connectivity to download packages and files.
AWS CLI properly configured with the necessary permissions to perform updates and install packages.
Usage
Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH.

Clone this repository to your EC2 instance:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Change into the repository directory:

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name
Run the deployment script:

bash
Copy code
sudo bash deploy_script.sh
The script will perform the following steps:

Update the system packages using yum update -y.
Install Apache HTTP server using yum install httpd -y.
Download and extract the X-Men Main Webpage from the GitHub repository.
Copy the webpage files to the Apache web server's document root (/var/www/html).
Enable and start the Apache HTTP server.
Once the script completes successfully, you can access the X-Men Main Webpage by navigating to your EC2 instance's public IP or domain name in your web browser.

Cleanup
The script automatically removes unnecessary files and directories after the deployment. These include main.zip, xmen-main, and xmen-main-webpage-main directories.
